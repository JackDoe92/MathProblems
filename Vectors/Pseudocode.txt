Length of a Vector
Take the components of the vector (x, y, z) as input.
Calculate the length using the formula:
length = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
Output the length.

Scalar Multiplication of a Vector
Take the components of the vector (x, y, z) as input.
Take the scalar value as input.
Multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:
new_x = x * scalar
new_y = y * scalar
new_z = z * scalar
Output the new vector: ([new_x], [new_y], [new_z]).

Addition of Two Vectors
Take the components of the first vector (x1, y1, z1) as input.
Take the components of the second vector (x2, y2, z2) as input.
Add the corresponding components:
result_x = x1 + x2
result_y = y1 + y2
result_z = z1 + z2
Output the resulting vector: ([result_x], [result_y], [result_z]).

Subtraction of Two Vectors
Take the components of the first vector (x1, y1, z1) as input.
Take the components of the second vector (x2, y2, z2) as input.
Subtract the corresponding components:
result_x = x1 - x2
result_y = y1 - y2
result_z = z1 - z2
Output the resulting vector: ([result_x], [result_y], [result_z]).
