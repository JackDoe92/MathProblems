Ask for input. 

Loop1
While the input mod 2 is 0, print 2.
---------------------------------------
Loop2
Start with divisor = 3.
While the squareroot of the divisor is less than or equal to the number:
- If the number is divisible by the divisor, print the divisor and divide the number by it.
Repeat this until the number is no longer divisible by the divisor.
Move to the next odd number (increment divisor by 2).
----------------------------------------
Loop3
If the number is greater than 1 after the loop, print the number (it is prime)
